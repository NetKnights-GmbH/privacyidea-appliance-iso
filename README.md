# privacyidea-appliance-iso

Create an installation ISO based on [ubuntu server](https://www.ubuntu.com/server) 16.04
to install the [privacyIDEA server](https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea)
and [Appliance](https://github.com/NetKnights-GmbH/privacyidea-appliance)

The process is loosely based on the
[Install CD Customization](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization)
documentation and the [script](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization/Scripts)
by Leigh Purdie.
